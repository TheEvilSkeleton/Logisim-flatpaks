# Unpublished Flatpak manifests

Personal Flatpak manifests I've written for anyone that wants to maintain

Here are the Flatpak manifests I've written:
- [ProtonVPN](https://github.com/TheEvilSkeleton/flatpaks/tree/com.protonvpn.ProtonVPN) - Doesn't work, but launches
- [Caprine](https://github.com/TheEvilSkeleton/flatpaks/tree/com.sindresorhus.Caprine) - Works
- [Logisim](https://github.com/TheEvilSkeleton/flatpaks/tree/net.sourceforge.carlburch.Logisim) - Works
- [MenuLibre](https://github.com/TheEvilSkeleton/flatpaks/tree/org.bluesabre.MenuLibre) - Works, but the `flatpak` command is not found, therefore flatpaks don't appear
- [Spigot](https://github.com/TheEvilSkeleton/flatpaks/tree/org.spigotmc.Spigot) - Works for the most part
